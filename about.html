    <h1>ABOUT </h1>
    <h2>Why I made this website -   As this website is for the development of women in the poor area's and villages. Village women donot have access to many facilities such as big markets , shopping mall's etc.They have  travell from  door to door in summer , winter and in monsoon seasons to sell home made item's .As the current age is the digital age and  almost every household are using  mobile phone, so they can access this website to sell their home made items to any corner of India by sitting at comfort of their home   .</h2>
